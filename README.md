The goal is to create an automated malware classification system that can -

1. Analyze malware features extracted from network traffic, executable files, or system behavior.
2. Train a machine learning model to classify malware into different families.
3. Predict the type of new/unseen malware based on learned patterns.
4. For this project, we used a Kaggle dataset that includes network traffic-based malware features.
