The goal is to create an automated malware classification system that can 
A) Analyze malware features extracted from network traffic, executable files, or system behavior.
B) Train a machine learning model to classify malware into different families.
C) Predict the type of new/unseen malware based on learned patterns.
For this project, we used a Kaggle dataset that includes network traffic-based malware features.
